make colors 1-n

-   use diff color schemes/palettes
-   maybe upload pic and auto gen color scheme from it?
-   get palettes by api from https://lospec.com/palette-list
    example:
    fetch('https://lospec.com/palette-list/oil-6.json').then(data=>data.json()).then(data=>console.log(data))
-   get palettes from images via https://coolors.co/image-picker

impl cellular automata (?)
as alternative impl: go from center, put blacks or whites, and repeat only on blacks

add shadows? darken light cell if black cell is below

impl solid/body/empty brushes to ensure some parts will be empty/solid/random
addone brush -- always solid but random color/shade

generate trees? full random bush, symmetric leg
